Astex Pharmaceuticals is a world leader in innovative drug discovery and development. The company has successfully applied its proprietary Fragment-Based Drug Discovery platform to generate multiple new drug candidates that are progressing in clinical development. Successful collaborations have led to three launched oncology drugs (Kisqali® partnered with Novartis, Balversa® partnered with Janssen and Truqap™ partnered with AstraZeneca). Astex continues to grow and focuses on Neurological Disorders and Oncology. 
Astex has a strong history in developing web-based applications to support its internal fragment-based drug discovery platform, carrying out cutting edge research in this area. This role will involve developing full-stack web applications for cheminformatics and structure-based design. 
The Role 
You will be working in a small team of developers, computational scientists and machine learning experts, collaborating with experimental scientists from across the organisation. You will work closely with users to understand their needs and deliver software to support their research. 
Our web applications typically use flask (python) and oracle at the back end, with the front end built with react or another JS/TS framework. There are opportunities to work with other technologies such as graph databases (Neo4j), WebGL, instrumentation robotics and machine learning methods. You will support scientists with their emerging project needs and will help maintain and extend our existing code base. 
Profile and Skills 
The ideal candidate will be a computer scientist with experience of working in a chemistry- and/or structural-biology-related discipline, or a computational chemist/biologist with an aptitude for software development. 
Expert knowledge in Python and/or Javascript 
Ideally, familiarity with relational databases, chemical databases (e.g. ChEMBL/WDI), and scripting using RDKit or similar toolkits 
Familiarity with git, CI and testing 
Good team working and communication skills
