Overview: 
The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) has a great opportunity for three Software Development Team Leaders to join us on a permanent full-time basis. 
At the RSC we embrace flexibility and offer hybrid working, which means our teams come together when they need to collaborate. Although this role is contractually based at our Cambridge office, you will also be able to work from home within the UK, with the expectation that you will attend our offices and travel as needed for your role. In this role you will attend our Cambridge office at least 1 day each week. If you need flexible working arrangements, please outline this in your application. 
The RSC has an exceptional diversity of audiences - from employees across the world, teachers, scientists and academics, librarians and corporates to politicians and the public. Our work includes activities focused on our role as a support service to UK and international staff, a data source (e.g. for developers consuming data via APIs), a professional body (e.g. supporting members), a publisher (e.g. selling journals, books and databases), and an education resource (e.g. providing content to teachers, students and professionals). Our technology services underpin the operations of all staff members and of our websites and services. 
As a Software Development Team Leader for the Royal Society of Chemistry, you will shape the software architecture and the fine grained detail of configuration and implementation throughout the software development lifecycle for performance, security and maintainability of the applications we build. 
Working within our DevOps team and with your colleagues across the directorate, you will lead a team of cross-functional technical staff, comprised of both back-end (.NET C#, node.JS), front-end (HTML/CSS/JS/Vue.JS) developers, test automation engineers and site reliability engineers. Your work will enable the Royal Society of Chemistry to build, scale and continually improve our websites and services, serving our global audience of customers, users and colleagues. You will oversee the technical aspects of the product roadmap, working closely in collaboration with Solutions Architects and other Team Leaders to align with, contribute to and iterate on a shared architectural repository, guiding agile workstream members in technical implementation, assigning and ensuring quality delivery of backlog items and taking ownership of technical changes and releases. You will also directly line manage a small number of back-end C# .NET developers. 
We are looking for: 
Strong knowledge and experience of full stack (.NET C# back-end development, HTML/CSS/JS/Vue.JS front-end development) software development life cycles. 
Experience with DevOps best practice, such as continuous delivery, continuous testing, infrastructure as code etc. 
Experience working within Agile practices, particularly Scrum and Kanban. 
People management experience including delivery quality, workloads and personal development. 
Knowledge of Authentication and Authorisation protocols (SAML, OpenID Connect). 
You can download the full job description here, please, that this role is called Tech Leader internally. If you are interested in this role, please apply now. This role is advertised until 31st March but as we are looking for several roles we will be conducting interviews regularly. 
When applying, please provide an up-to-date CV and a supporting statement (no more than 500 words) indicating how your skills, knowledge and competencies match the requirements outlined in the job description here. 
At the RSC, we recognise the benefits of a diverse workforce and welcome applicants from a range of backgrounds to apply. We particularly encourage applications from disabled and ethnic minority candidates. As a part of the Disability Confident Scheme, we endeavour, where possible, to offer an interview to candidates meeting the essential criteria of the role, who have a substantial physical/mental impairment which impacts their ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. 
We are committed to making our recruitment processes accessible to all and as part of this, we are flexible in the ways we give and receive information. If you would like to apply using a different format, please contact the Recruitment Team at jobs@rsc.org or on +44 (0) 1223 432229 and we will do our best to put any reasonable adjustments in place.
